# Compact High-Performance Portable Speaker

Overview
This project focuses on designing and building a compact portable speaker that delivers powerful, high-quality sound from a small form factor. The goal is to move beyond rough handmade builds and create a clean, well-engineered product using proper design, planning, and documentation.

In previous projects, limited tools and materials often resulted in unfinished or visually rough prototypes. With this project, the focus is on improving build quality, structure, and overall performance.

Project Concept
The speaker will use a multi-driver configuration to achieve a balanced and full sound:
- Full-range driver for mids
- Tweeter for clear high frequencies
- Woofer positioned at the bottom for strong low-frequency response

The system is intended to be portable, efficient, and well-tuned for everyday listening.

Goals
- Design a compact speaker that delivers strong, balanced sound
- Apply proper engineering design principles
- Improve enclosure quality and internal layout
- Learn acoustic basics such as driver placement, enclosure volume, and port tuning
- Document the full development process from concept to final build

Design & Fabrication
The enclosure and internal components are planned to be designed digitally. If access to a 3D printer is available, it would be used to:
- Prototype a precise speaker enclosure
- Create mounts for drivers, amplifier, and battery
- Improve internal structure and cable management
- Achieve a clean, professional finish

Current Status
The project is currently in the planning and research phase. I am selecting components, exploring enclosure designs, and learning how different design choices affect sound quality and efficiency.

Future Plans
- Finalize the driver configuration and enclosure design
- Build and test prototypes
- Measure and evaluate sound performance
- Refine the design based on testing results
- Fully document the build process with diagrams, photos, and notes

Motivation
This project represents an important learning step for me. My goal is to build something that is not only functional, but also well-designed and visually clean. I am seeking guidance, structure, and feedback to help turn an idea into a finished, high-quality engineering project.
